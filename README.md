# Shopper-Logger

This app allows delivery drivers to log their orders. Currently, it allows them to fill out an order form that includes: Time stamp, notes, pictures. All data is persisted locally

-> Add delete functionality to swipeable cells
-> Change binary storage of data from SQLite to saving filepath URL and reference the images that way (performance enhancement)
